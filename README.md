## Missing

Greetings. 

If I had had a bit more time to develop this test I would created separate components for "Character", as well as tiny presentational (AKA "dumb") separate components for Film, Starship, Vehicle, Species data; and propagate the data from the main component to those subcomponents (using props, proplery typed at each "propTypes")
